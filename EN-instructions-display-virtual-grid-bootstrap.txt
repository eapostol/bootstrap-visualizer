INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Only use this tool to check your structure visually
during code design with Bootstrap 5 and above.
Preferably before putting content in it (images, texts, etc.).
However it is possible to use it with embedded content.
In this case, this will inevitably have an impact on the rendering since the CSS acts directly on the classes:
     .container, container-*, container-fluid, .row, .col, col-* and .col-*-*.

2) Place "display-virtual-grid-bootstrap.css" in your project's CSS folder.

3) Put the "display-virtual-grid-bootstrap.js" file in the JS folder of your project.

4) The following 3 lines of code are to be integrated into the <head> of the desired HTML page,
always after bootstrap's css call, but before your own style.css:

<!-- CSS and JS display-virtual-grid-bootstrap -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="your-url/display-virtual-grid-bootstrap.css">
<script defer src="your-url/display-virtual-grid-bootstrap.js"></script>

Note: Replace "your-url" with your own project tree path.

5) It is imperative to respect the two basic structures of bootstrap so that the library
display-virtual-grid-bootstrap works correctly:

section[header|footer|article|div|other]
    div.container
        div.row
            div[article|autre].col|.col-*|.col-*-*]
                div[article|autre][.card|.myclass|.other]

OR

section[header|footer|article|div|other]
    div.container-fluid
        div.row
            div[article|autre].col|.col-*|.col-*-*]
                div[article|autre][.card|.myclass|.other]

6) Once integrated, a "GRID ON" button will be created automatically at the top left of the page.
By default the bootstrap virtual grid visualization system is enabled.
If you want to disable it temporarily, just click on the button.
Do the same to reactivate visualization.

NOTE: A cookie will be created. It allows to keep the active or not active state of the visualization of the grid
even after a page refresh.

WARNING: The creation of the cookie only works if you go through a server (local or online).
For example Lamp, Mamp, Wamp, Xampp or Live Server from VSCode are perfectly suitable.

7) Remember to delete the lines of code integrated in the <head> and to remove the files
of your project once you no longer need the library.

Have fun !
